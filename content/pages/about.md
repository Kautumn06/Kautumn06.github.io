### Brief Introduction
This website is primarily intended as my development journal, so it will most
often contain my notes and ramblings as I continue to learn Python and work on
ML projects.

My hope is that this will be a way to help me clarify my thoughts and to keep track 
of my progress—or lack thereof. And if helps someone else who is
struggling—since I certainly know what that is like―then that would be nice
too.

If you're interested in my resume, you can find a PDF copy of it [here]({filename}/pdfs/resume.pdf). Or if you prefer a somewhat more random overview:

> Aspiring data scientist. Lover of cats, Python and pandas (both the animals and the python library), 19th and 20th century Russian literature, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Cleveland Browns football, Winston Churchill biographies, and cleaning data (I find it soothing. And yes, I know that's strange).
